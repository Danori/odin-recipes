  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
    <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth     
    <li>6 medium potatoes, thinly sliced     
    <li>1 cup heavy cream     
    <li>1/4 bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>
      Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over
      medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15
      minutes. Drain and set aside. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10
      minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in
      the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions and garlic; cook until
      onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes
      and simmer until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium;
      stir in cream, cooked sausage, and spinach. Cook and stir until
      spinach has wilted and sausage is warmed through; serve. 
    </li>
  </ol>
