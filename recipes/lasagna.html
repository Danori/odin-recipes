  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
    made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more 
    traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my 
    mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
    I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and 
    crusty garlic bread.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
    <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
    <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>
      Combine ground beef, onion, garlic, and green pepper in a large 
      saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until meat is browned and 
      crumbly and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain grease.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste into the pan.
      Season with oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer spaghetti sauce for 
      1 hour, stirring occasionally. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
      noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
      with cold water.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
      tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. 
    </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>
      To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
      9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
      Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the
      mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
      and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
      Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
      spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake
      for an additional 25 minutes. 
    </li>
    <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>
